# inspire
A command line tool that produces words of inspiration, written in Go Language

Features
==========================================
When the application is run, you are presented with a quick menu for using the app:

	- Quick
	- Schedule
	- Customize
	- Favorites
	- About

Each of these are quite straightforward, but can be used for customizing your inspirational experience!

Quick
==========================================
The standard go-to run of the application, where we just present you with a quote of inspiration. Once produced, the application will exit with the assumption you've been inspired enough!

Schedule
==========================================
Want to be surprised with your inspirations? After all, the best times to get inspired are the times you don't know you want to be inspired! That's probably not true, but we'll stick with it anyway. In here, you can adjust all time settings so that either on a regular or completely random schedule, you will receive some inspiration. 

Customize
==========================================
Here you can change all the miscellaneous settings that don't have to do with timing of quotes, such as appearance (colors) and the like. You can also select specific sources of inspiration, namely speakers or solely from favorites list or < 50 chars etc...


Favorites
==========================================
Contains your favorite list of inspirational quotes and their speakers

About
==========================================
Just a quick about page for me (shameless self-endorsement) and the product. Also, check out this (kinda new) golang language -- it's sick! If you want additional settings or changes, please feel free to fork or drop a comment!
